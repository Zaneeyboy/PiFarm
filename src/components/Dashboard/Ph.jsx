                    are most available to plants.</p>
                <p>For instance, at 7.0, which is outside the most suitable range for vegetables, plants are still capable of taking up such elements as nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium.
                   At this level though, the trace elements are becoming lost to the plants; the amounts of iron, maganese, boron, copper, zinc and molybdenum are generally cut in half.
                   So if your pH is above 7, be on the lookout for trace element problems rather than those caused by macronutrients nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium.</p>

                            <p>
                                 The term "pH" stands for "potential hydrogen" because hydrogen ions (H+) and hydroxide ions (OH-) are what cause a solution to be basic or acidic. 
                                 pH tests measure the concentration of these two substancs on a scale from 1 to 14 indicating how acidic a solution is or how basic it is accordingly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is important to understand how basic or acidic your solution is because it tells you about nutrient availability, the hardness of your source water, and it can help you identify deficiencies. 
                                For the most part, nutrients are most available between a pH range of 5.5 to 6.5. Beyong this range, trace elements become lost to your plants even if they are present in your nutrient solution.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Take iron for example. It comes in two forms - ferric and ferrous. Ferric has a charge of +3 and is unavailable to plants. Ferrous iron, on the other hand, has a charge of +2 and is available to plants. Iron fluctuates between these two forms in your system. As it is, ferrous iron can quickly become ferrir iron in a system with a high pH because of the way it reacts with hydrogen ions. Therefore, in higher pH symptoms, plants can more quickly develop iron deficiencies.
