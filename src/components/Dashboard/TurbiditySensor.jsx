                        <h1>PPM in hydroponics</h1>
                        <p>In hydroponics, fast growth and high yields are made possible by the use of concentrated minerals and macronutrients. 
                        But this success is often decided by the finest of margins. 
                        As a grower, you have to find the Goldilocks zone of nutrient strength to help your plants grow properly. 
                        If you add too many nutrients, your plants can be affected by a severe case of a nutrient burn. 
                        Too little may have them stunted and flowering poorly. The lesson to take away here is to keep a strict eye on your nutrient solution.</p>
                        <p>PPM here as a measure of water quality is important in hydroponics due to these facts. 
                        Different plants require different levels of PPM  to ensure optimized growth. 
                        As an example, lettuce requires a PPM level of 560-840ppm to grow optimally while celery requires a range of 1260-1400.</p>
                        <p>Hydroponic farmers growing a variety of crops need to be mindful of this and find the right balance of nutrient concentration if several crops are
                         being deployed nutrients from the same nutrient mix.</p>
                         <p>Doing research on each type of plant you grow can help you decide what can be grown in the current cycle if you aim to grow several types of crops together. 
                         However, to ensure fast growth and maximum yield in a shorter time, measure frequently and adjust accordingly.</p>
