                            <p>In hydroponics, soil moisture is only a concern with certain types of systems. Our major concern here though is the soil moisture level of a drip to waste system.
                            So why is soil moisture important? Soil moisture measures the degree of saturation of your growing media in your hydroponic system. This is important because a media that is
                            overly saturated can cause root rot in your plant roots and if the media is too dry, the plant can burn from heat or become stunted.</p>
                            <p>Soil moisture is becoming more of a concern especially in the hotter climates primarily because of climate change and by extension, global warming. Increasingly, 
                            it becomes an issue for the hydroponic farmer to leave their system during the day if they do not own a shade house that covers the system because of the heat, especially during the dry season.</p>
                            <p>Maintaining your system with an adequate level of moisture in your system can mean the difference between losing your cycle of plants or seeing them live till yield. However, it is important that you not overly deploy and dampen the growing media with nutrients or water specifically because it may end up doing more harm than good. In addition to root rot, your plant can also suffer from nutrient burn if the growing media is too damp. Therefore, you should deploy nutrients as needed but not in excess. </p>
